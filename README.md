# random-raccoon-image-finder
I absoultely adore raccoons, so I created a way to get randomized raccoon images for a little laugh.\
<br />
When you run main.py, you will be asked for the amount of images you want and the dowload location! After those things are specified, you can enjoy your raccoons!
  * Make sure to use "/" when specifying download location (Ex: D:/Pictures/Raccoons)
  * Note: Refrain from using these images commercially! These are web scraped images for your own _personal_ use.
